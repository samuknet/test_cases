<title>Image with opacity gets clipped when nearby text input 'overflows' with characters</title>
<meta charset="utf-8" />
<style>
body {
	font-family: arial;
	text-align: center;
}

img {
	opacity: 0.9; /* Opacity must be set to anything other than 1 for the white rectangle to appear */
}

p {
	text-align: initial;
}
</style>

<p>
The issue occurs when there is a text input near an image and the text input is 'filled up' with characters.  As soon as the text input overflows a white rectangle clips the corner of the image. This happens as soon as the text field has a character entered that makes it's size too small to display all the characters.
</p>

<p>
The issue only occurs when the image has a CSS property set to anything other than 1. Also, the the image must be within a certain 'closeness' to the text input for the issue to occur.

<img src="../servo.png" />
<input type="text" size="35" value="One character over the size causes the issue" /> <!-- Removing characters so that the text input is not filled up stops the issue. !-->
